## Building a container from new image created in chapter2

To create a docker container from your newly created image run the following command:


###### List image you are going to use to build container
```
$ docker images

REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
nohtyp/web_server   v1                  4f9997a3321c        13 hours ago        451.7 MB
```

###### Note: The '-i' is for interactive login to the container
######       and '-t' is pseudo-terminal (which gives you back the terminal feedback).

##### Build container from image without the correct image tag
```
docker run -i -t nohtyp/web_server /bin/bash
Unable to find image 'nohtyp/web_server:latest' locally
``` 

##### Build container from image with the correct image tag
``` 
docker run -i -t nohtyp/web_server:v1 /bin/bash
bash-4.3# 
```

As you can see the container is up and running and contains the httpd package:
```
bash-4.3# rpm -qa |grep httpd
httpd-tools-2.4.16-1.fc21.x86_64
fedora-logos-httpd-21.0.5-1.fc21.noarch
httpd-2.4.16-1.fc21.x86_64
httpd-filesystem-2.4.16-1.fc21.noarch
``` 

##### Show the name and status of the current container
```
This will put you back at the hosts command prompt:
$ exit
 
The following will show the id, image, last command (within the container), exit status, name of the container:

$ docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE  h                COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
194fae551f87b        nohtyp/web_server:v1   "/bin/bash"         38 minutes ago      Exited (0) 7 seconds ago                       loving_goodall      
```

In the output you can see that the name given to the container (loving_goodall) was randomly generated by docker when building the container. To
create a container with a specified name (which should help you keep track).

The following commands should work for you:

```
docker run -i --name "webserver_demo" -t nohtyp/web_server:v1 /bin/bash
```

When you exit from the container, and on the command prompt of the host you can run the following to see the name for the container:

```
docker ps -l
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
c31563591fc7        nohtyp/web_server:v1   "/bin/bash"         12 seconds ago      Exited (0) 4 seconds ago                       webserver_demo
```
